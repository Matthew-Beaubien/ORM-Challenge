## ORM Challenge/E-Commerce back end

When the user runs 'node server.js', after the console log message confirms the port the server is listening on, the user can open insomnia and begin to explore the product database.
Unfortunately I forgot to enter in the data so although everything works and the user is able to add entries and delete entries, the product is incomplete. I do plan on finishing it to see how it would look.
